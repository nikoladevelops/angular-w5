    <h2>Why use crypto?</h2>

    <section>
        <h4>Decentralization:</h4>
        <p>Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate on technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers (nodes). There is no central authority, like a bank or government, controlling the currency.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Blockchain Technology:</h4>
        <p>A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptographic techniques. Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, ensuring transparency and security.</p>
    </section>   

    <section>
        <h4>Cryptographic Security:</h4>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic methods to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Public-key cryptography allows users to generate a pair of keys: a public key, which serves as an address, and a private key, which is used to sign transactions and prove ownership.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Digital Nature:</h4>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies exist only in digital form and are not tangible like paper money or coins. They can be stored in digital wallets, which can be software-based or hardware devices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Limited Supply:</h4>
        <p>Many cryptocurrencies have a capped supply, meaning there is a maximum limit to how many units can ever be created. For example, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins.</p>
